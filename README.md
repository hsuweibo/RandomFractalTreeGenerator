### About RandomFractalTreeGenerator
A fractal tree is a tree that grows from its trunk in a mathematically re-ocurring, recursive manner. This fractal tree generator generates random fractal trees by recursively splitting each branch into two branches at each branching point, and adding a random amount of "twist" and "curveness" to each resulting branch. Each tree also gets a random colorization.
